        Olich is a text editor with support for syntax 
        highlighting for C. It is based closely on the 
        <a class="link" href="https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/">
        kilo</a> text editor. It is alpha software and is not maintained
        so I don't encourage replacing your current text editor with this
        one. Please don't edit important files using this editor ðŸ˜….

      <p class="thin">

        SiTeFL is a Simple Text Formatting Language, with a text-to-html
        tool to go along with it. While it keeps some of markdown's
        features, it is quite minimal in its feature-set. To see a full list
        of features, check out the README in the GitHub repository.

        You can also try the web version of sitefl at : <a class="link"

        Colon is a toy programming language that I am designing based on my

      <p class="thin">
        Bru is an HDL based electronics simulator. It stitches together HDL
        files and input(script) files to produce a Go program, which when
        run, outputs the results of the simulation.

        I've made a YouTube playlist on the basics of this tool. It can be
        found

        Dynar</span>
      </a></p>
      <p class="thin">
        Dynar is a C preprocessor of sorts that lets you use dynamic arrays
        as if they were an inbuilt datatype in C. It lets you create
        resizable arrays and provides functions to push, pop, insert and
        delete elements in/belonging to the array.
