<a href="https://aelobdog.github.io/wrang">Wrang</a>

</h3>
Wrang is a markup language, similar to markdown. It has a <em>different syntax</em>, a <em>smaller scope</em> and is <em>not a replacement</em> for the feature rich tool that markdown is. It serves the purpose of making my job easier when writing simple static webpages.

<a href="https://aelobdog.github.io/lih2">Lih2</a>

</h3>
Lih2 is a shell script that I use to maintain my personal blog. It uses wrang to convert wrang-markup files to html. If you're running a Windows machine and still want to use it, try it on WSL !

<a href="https://aelobdog.github.io/cuppu86">Cuppu86</a>

</h3>
Cuppu86 is an experimental 8086 CPU simulator backend which I wrote alongside a course on microprocessors that I took in university. The course focused a lot on 8086 assembly programming, but I was much too interested in knowing how that assembly actually runs to not try and implement a CPU simulator. I hadn't understood how interrupts work while implementing the project, and so the 4 instructions that involve interrupts things were left unimplemented. Even so, the project covers 98% of the ISA.

<a href="https://github.com/aelobdog/cgsimrd">CGSIMRD</a>

</h3>
CGSIMRD, or Coarse Grained Simulation of RNA and DNA, is a software package that aids in performing coarse grain simulations of RNA and DNA using LAMMPS. It consists of a few shell scripts that make it easier to use LAMMPS for DNA/RNA simulations. This was developed as part of a Study Project I did in university, and while there were no concrete conclusions that came from my study it was clear that this set of scripts was pretty handy.

<a href="https://aelobdog.github.io/bru">Bru</a>

</h3>
Bru is a command line tool to design and simulate combinational as well as sequencial circuits. I developed this alongside the course on Digital Design that I did in university. Most of what we did in that course revolved around performing the simulations in our imagination and I wanted something better. While there are some limitations to what kinds of circuits Bru can simulate, it is still an interesting tool that is fun to play with.

<a href="https://aelobdog.github.io/colon-lang">Colon-lang</a>

</h3>
Colon is an interpreted toy programming language. It is a product of my learnings from 
<a href="https://thorstenball.com/books/">Thorsten Ball's Book</a>
 on the Monkey Programing Language, with a syntax that is loosely based on that an older project I co-authored Axolotl.

</h3>
Bmp-vyu is an image viewer for <code>.bmp</code> files written in C using Raylib
